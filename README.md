# IFC Fragment Viewer

A lightweight, fully client-side web application that lets anyone upload an IFC file,
converts it instantly to the optimized `.frag` binary format, renders it in a
high-performance 3D viewer, and allows downloading the converted file for fast reuse.

> Built with Vite + React + TypeScript + @thatopen/fragments

## What It Does

```
User uploads .ifc file
        ↓
IfcImporter (WASM, Web Worker) converts → .frag binary
        ↓
FragmentsModels loads buffer → Three.js scene renders model
        ↓
User explores model in 3D + downloads .frag for fast future loads
```

Everything runs in the browser. No server. No data leaves the user's machine.
